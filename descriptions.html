      <h1>What do those characteristics mean? </h1>

      <h2> Sweetness </h2>
       <p> Wine labels often use the terms “sweet,” “semi-sweet” or “dry.” 
       <br> </b> A dry wine will not be sweet at all.</p>

       <h2> Acidity </h2>
       <p>Wines with high acidity will be more tart, 
       whereas low-acidity wines will taste rounder or richer. </p>

       <h2>Body</h2>
       <p>Wines get characterized as having a light body, full body or 
  somewhere in between. The “body” of the wine refers to how 
  heavy or light it feels in your mouth. Generally, red wines 
  have a fuller body than whites, as do wines made from grapes 
       grown in warmer regions, rather than cooler ones.</p>

       <h2>Alcohol</h2>
       <p>The higher the percentage of alcohol in your glass of wine, 
       the more it will warm your throat and the back of your mouth. 
       Measured in percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV), most wines 
       contain 11 to 13 percent alcohol, but can range from 5.5 percent 
       all the way up to 20 percent.</p> </article>
